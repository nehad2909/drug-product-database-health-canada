# Drug shortages in Canada
### Forecasting model to predict the probability of drug shortage based into historical data and predict their probability of shortage
-----

# About the project
This project aims to make us aware of the problem that most people have faced at least once in their daily life: shortage of drugs and medicine

The availability and affordability of essential medicines are crucial for the health and well-being of the population. Essential medicines are those that satisfy the priority health care needs of the people and are selected based on public health relevance, evidence of efficacy and safety, and comparative cost-effectiveness.

This can have serious consequences for the quality of care, patient outcomes, health equity, and economic development. Therefore, it is important to assess the availability and affordability of essential medicines in different settings and identify the factors that influence them. This project aims to provide a survey and analysis of the availability and the probability of shortage of essential medicines in high, mid, low, lower depending of the historical.

  ## Problem Statment
  - No found any platform or updated information with drug shortage prediction
  - Existing papers and research point to possible consequences, but fail to predict the potential threat of a new drug shortage.

  ## Proposed Solution
  -  Create a model based on the historical data from 2017 to now using Python Prophet library, forecasting time series data based in additive model that can handle trend, seasonality, and other factors.
